<h2><strong>COMMUNICATIONS SETTINGS</strong></h2>
<p>Accessible for: <strong>Administrator</strong></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-07.png" /></p>
<h3><strong>COMMUNICATIONS</strong></h3>
<p>Accessible for: <strong>Administrator</strong></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-10.png" /></p>
<p>•   Select the SKU Number. </p>
<p>•   Select the Communication String from the Tool using Drop-Down Box.</p>

 </p>
<h3><strong>MODBUS TCP</strong></h3>
<p>Accessible for: <strong>Administrator</strong> and <strong>Maintenance</strong></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-08.png" /></p>
<p>• Select the <strong>ModbusTCP</strong> option, and the application will act as the Modbus TCP client, while the PLC will act as the Modbus TCP server.</p>
<p>• The IP address, port number, start address, and multiplication factor (for digital values) will be configured in the settings.</p>
<p>• The heartbeat interval for the Quality Inspection application to monitor the Modbus TCP register for read/write operations is 30 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Handshaking of Registers between the PLC and ModbusTCP in the Quality Inspection Application is explained below.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-29.png" /></p>
<p>The standard Modbus registers are pre-configured with their register locations, but these locations can be reconfigured. This option is accessible only to administrators.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNICATION:</strong> This is used to establish a heartbeat communication between the Quality Inspection application and the PLC. Every 5 seconds, the application writes a register value of '1', and the PLC checks if the value is '1'. If the value is not '1' within the heartbeat period, the PLC will detect a communication issue. The PLC will then write a register value of '2'.</p>
<p><strong>SKUID:</strong>  To select an SKU from the PLC, the PLC will write the SKU ID to the SKUID register location. Refer to SKU Management to find the SKUID for each SKU.</p>
<p><strong>SKUID_FEEDBACK:</strong> The application will monitor the SKUID, and if a valid SKUID is read from the SKUID register location, the respective SKU will be loaded into the application (all camera and inspection parameters will be loaded and ready for inspection). Once the SKU is successfully loaded, the application will write the same SKUID value to the SKUID_FEEDBACK register. When the PLC reads this value, it will reset the register to '0'.</p>
<p><em>Example :</em> The PLC will send the value '5' to the SKUID register. The application will then look for and load the SKU with SKUID '5'. Upon successful loading of the SKU, the value '5' will be sent back to the SKUID_FEEDBACK register location.</p>
<p><strong>TRIGGER:</strong>  To start the inspection of an object, the PLC will write the value '1' to the TRIGGER register location.</p>
<p><strong>TRIGGER_FEEDBACK:</strong> Once the application reads the TRIGGER register with the value '1', the TRIGGER register will be reset to '0', and the TRIGGER_FEEDBACK register will be written with '1'. The PLC will receive the TRIGGER_FEEDBACK and reset its value to '0'.</p>
<p><strong>CAMERA_STATUS:</strong> The application will write the value to the CAMERA_STATUS register. The PLC will monitor this status and perform the process steps according to its automation cycle.</p>
<pre><code>Register Value as 3 =&gt; if the inspection is in progress.
Register Value as 2 =&gt; ready to take the trigger
Register Value as 0 =&gt; camera is not yet ready
</code></pre>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong> The application will write the value to the RESULT register. The PLC will monitor this result and perform the process steps according to its automation cycle.</p>
<pre><code>Register Value as 2 =&gt; if the Result is FAIL.
Register Value as 1 =&gt; if the Result is PASS.
Register Value as 0 =&gt; if the Result is Not Yet Ready.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Location of MODBUS Registers:</strong></p>
<p>Register Location: Start Address [Refer Settings] + Register Location</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-25.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-26.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-27.png" /></p>
<p>•   Open Modbus Server in the <strong>PLC</strong>.</p>
<p>•   Click the <strong>CONNECT</strong> button. If Modbus is enabled on the PLC, the Modbus TCP Client application will connect; otherwise, it will not connect.</p>
<p>•   Write Registers: Select the Value and Click on <strong>ADD</strong> Button.</p>
<p>•   Write Registers: Click on <strong>WRITE MULTIPLE REGISTERS</strong> Button.</p>
<p>•   Read Registers: Click on <strong>READ MULTIPLE REGISTERS</strong> Button.</p>
<p>•   The values that are written should be readable..</p>
<p>•   Click on <strong>DISCONNECT</strong> button.</p>
<p>•   Click the <strong>BACK</strong> button to return to the dashboard.</p>
<h3><strong>TCP SERVER</strong></h3>
<p>Accessible for: <strong>Administrator</strong> and <strong>Maintenance</strong></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-09.png" /></p>
<p>Select the <strong>TCP Server</strong> option, and the application will act as a TCP server, while the PLC will act as a TCP client. The following are the TCP server commands used to control the application in the inspection screen:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Reset the Job</strong>
    Syntax: SKU_RESET
    Response: SUCCESS or FAILURE</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Get the List of Jobs Available</strong>
    Syntax: SKU_LIST
    Response: Provides a list of jobs, separated by commas.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Select the Job</strong> – 3 Ways to Load Job
    Syntax: SKUCODE_jobName
    Example: SKUCODE_newjob1
    Response: SUCCESS or FAILURE</p>
<pre><code>Syntax: SKUID_jobID
Example: SKUID_001
Response: SUCCESS or FAILURE

Syntax: SKUIDCODE _jobID-jobName
Example: SKUIDCODE_001-newjob1
Response: SUCCESS or FAILURE
Action: The Application will load the respective SKU Settings to the inspection.
</code></pre>
<p>(4) <strong>Trigger Image</strong>
    Syntax: TRIGGER_filename
    Example: TRIGGER_range-image_00001
    Response: Data which is configured in Communications</p>
<p>(5) <strong>Trigger Camera</strong> 
    Syntax: TRIGGER
    Response: Data which is configured in Communications</p>
<p>To simulate a TCP client, you can use the <strong>Hercules</strong> application, which can be downloaded from the internet.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="path/image-28.png" /></p>
<p>•   Click on <strong>START SERVER</strong> button.</p>
<p>•   Open the <strong>Hercules</strong> application and launch the <strong>TCP Client</strong>. Enter the IP address as '127.0.0.1' or the IP address displayed on the TCP Server screen.</p>
<p>•   Enter the port number configured in the TCP server into the TCP client.</p>
<p>•   Click on <strong>Connect Button</strong> in the TCP Client.</p>
<p>•   Send some data from the TCP client and check if it is received by the TCP server.</p>
<p>•   Send some data from TCP Server and check if it is received by the TCP Client.</p>
<p>•   If data transmission between the <strong>TCP client</strong> and <strong>TCP server</strong> is successful, we can confirm that the TCP server is working as expected.</p>
<p>•   Click on <strong>STOP SERVER</strong> button.</p>
<p>•   Click on <strong>BACK</strong> button to return to the Dashboard.</p>
